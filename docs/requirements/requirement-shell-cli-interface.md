**file**: docs/requirements/requirement-shell-cli-interface.md  
**Status**: Active (Version 1.0.0)  
**Philosophy**: CIAO / CIAO-Lite (Caution • Intentional • Anti-fragile • Over-engineered)

## 1. Purpose

This requirement is the **project Single Source of Truth** for the **POSIX shell CLI interface** of the nginx-config tool: command surface, privilege typing, global flags, dispatcher behavior, output modes, and interactive vs non-interactive rules.

It names **every routed verb twice** (this file + a topic-owner). Self-management verbs are **normal user privilege** (you, as yourself). Domain host-mutating verbs are **admin privilege** (already root) and are owned in detail by `requirement-domain-nginx-config`.

**Scope:** User-facing command names, flags, dispatch, privilege labels, and mode contracts.  
**Out of scope (own requirements when specialized):** Online-install checksum mechanics detail, self-management safety beyond the command surface, shell coding style, full output-function catalog (cited, not re-owned). Domain **semantics** (profiles, placeholders, apply) stay on `requirement-domain-nginx-config` — this file still **names** those verbs.

### 1.1 Human-facing

**In one sentence:** You type `nginx-config <command>` (or no command: install the first time, numbered list later on a terminal). Help lists every live command; unknown names fail with a pointer to `help`.

| Box | Meaning | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| You / this login | Install, help, about, update this program as yourself | `nginx-config about` |
| The other role | Root session to apply a rendered conf | `sudo nginx-config apply example.com` |
| Not this file | Checksum algorithm; profile sample bodies | peer requirements |

| Includes | Excludes |
|----------|----------|
| Command table, flags, dispatcher, unknown-command | GitLab `run` / `ssh-hostname` |
| Naming domain verbs (dual mention); numbered list claimed | Empty argv = help |

| Surface | What you open | What for |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| `nginx-config help` | command | listed verbs |
| `./nginx-config` | program file | `app_main` dispatch |

| You do… | What it means | What you type |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| See commands | Human help lists domain rows and self-management rows. JSON help is a short object. | `nginx-config help` |

## 2. Core Rules / Requirements (Mandatory)

### 2.1 Command surface (portable shape)

Every CIAO-Lite shell CLI **MUST** expose a documented command set. Commands **MUST** map to exactly one privilege type. Unclassified commands are incomplete design.

| Category | Privilege | Meaning | Portable examples |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Type 0 – Self-management / CLI lifecycle** | Invoking user (no elevation required for user-owned install) | Manage the CLI binary and diagnostics | `version`, `about`, `help`, `version-check`, `self-update`, `self-uninstall` |
| **Type 0 – Install CLI binary** | Invoking user (root → global path; non-root → user path) | First-time or explicit placement of the CLI | `install`; empty argv **Type O install-ensure** (not installed / local / global) — `requirement-shell-cli-zero-arguments.md` |
| **Admin privilege (workshop Type 1)** | Already root (or documented escalation) | Write rendered conf into nginx; dedicated-account teardown | `apply`, `remove-lpu` — **topic-owner:** `requirement-domain-nginx-config` |
| **Work commands (this login)** | Invoking user | Profile catalog and render into persistence | `domains`, `profiles`, `nginx-conf`, `menu` / `main` — **topic-owner:** `requirement-domain-nginx-config` |
| **Dedicated system user privilege (workshop Type 2)** | Run *as* `nginx-adm` | Not a CLI verb today | No routed Type 2 command |

**Execution rules (core):**

1. Type 0 commands **MUST** run as the invoker without requiring a dedicated system user.
2. Type 1 (when added later) **MUST** use controlled internal escalation; normal users **MUST NOT** be forced to manually prefix every privileged sub-step as a permanent UX rule.
3. Type 2 (when added later) **MUST** run as the dedicated system user (context switch if needed). Mixing Type 1 host bootstrap with Type 2 app toolchain in one command is forbidden (see incident policy under system-user / three-layer privilege terms).
4. Privilege type for each command **MUST** be documented in help and in this requirement’s Implementation Notes.

### 2.2 Global flags (portable)

| Flag | Env / state | Behavior |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `--quiet`, `-q` | `QUIET=1` | Suppress non-error human output; errors and fatal paths still visible |
| `--json` | `JSON=1` (implies quiet) | Machine-readable structured output; no human banner text |
| `--debug` | `DEBUG=1` | Extra diagnostics when designed (must not break JSON purity on stdout) |
| `--force` | Force/reinstall policy vars | Skip safe confirms or force reinstall only where documented; never silent security bypass |

Additional flags **MAY** be added only when documented here (or a superseding requirement) and wired in the dispatcher.

### 2.3 Dispatcher and entry rules (portable)

1. **Single entry:** A single main dispatcher (e.g. `app_main`) **MUST** parse global flags and route commands.
2. **Unknown command:** **MUST** fail loudly with a clear error and pointer to `help` (via output SSOT).
3. **Zero-arg:** Empty argv **MUST** follow `requirement-shell-cli-zero-arguments` (not-installed install-ensure; installed+TTY numbered list; installed+script already-installed). **MUST NOT** default `COMMAND=help` on empty argv.
4. **Idempotent install skip:** Install **MUST** no-op when already installed unless force/reinstall policy is set.
5. **No raw user I/O:** User-facing messages **MUST** go through the centralized `out_*` system (see output template/term).

### 2.4 Output and mode contracts (portable)

| Mode | Contract |
|------|----------|
| Human (default TTY) | Prefixed messages via `out_*`; colors only when TTY and not quiet/json |
| Quiet | Suppress info/success/plain noise; still show errors / fatal |
| JSON | Force quiet; emit structured JSON via `out_json` / `out_json_error`; no mixed human lines on success path |
| Non-interactive | Never hang on prompts; use safe defaults or `--force`/env policy |

Destructive Type 0 actions (e.g. uninstall) **MUST** confirm when interactive unless force policy is set; non-interactive **MUST NOT** block on stdin.

### 2.5 Help surface (portable)

`help` **MUST** list:

- Usage line  
- Every supported command with one-line purpose  
- Privilege category (at least Type 0 vs elevated vs system-user when those exist)  
- Global flags  

In JSON mode, help **MUST NOT** dump long human text; return a short structured success/note object instead.

### 2.6 Implementation Notes (this project)

| Item | Value for nginx-config |
|------|------------------------|
| **Product / binary name** | `nginx-config` (`APP_NAME`, default `nginx-config`) |
| **Primary executable** | Repo root `./nginx-config` (POSIX `/bin/sh`, single-file for `curl \| sh`) |
| **Dispatcher** | `app_main` (always invoked at end of script: `app_main "$@"` — no `${0##*/}` / APP_NAME basename gate; required for `curl \| sh`) |
| **Output SSOT** | `out_text` + wrappers (`out_info`, `out_success`, `out_warn`, `out_error`, `out_die`, `out_plain`, `out_json`, …) |
| **Version SSOT** | `VERSION` hard-assign in script config block (`VERSION="1.0.0"`) |
| **Install paths** | Global: `GLOBAL_BIN` default `/usr/local/bin`; User: `USER_BIN` default `${HOME}/.local/bin` |
| **Remote channel env (help surface)** | `REPO_USER` / `REPO_NAME` (defaults `cloudgen` / `nginx-conf`); `SCRIPT_URL` composed default `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/${REPO_USER}/${REPO_NAME}/main/${APP_NAME}` (literal product default: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudgen/nginx-conf/main/nginx-config`; override via env). **`help` / `about` MUST list these operator channel vars as designed — MUST NOT list `CHECKSUM`** |
| **Admin-privilege commands** | Named here; **owned** by `requirement-domain-nginx-config`: `apply`, `remove-lpu` |
| **Work domain commands** | Named here; owned by domain REQ: `domains`, `profiles`, `nginx-conf`, `menu` / `main` |
| **Dedicated system user** | **Not required** for CLI self-management; `remove-lpu` tears down `nginx-adm` only |

#### Supported commands (normative for this project)

| Command | Type | Handler (current) | Required behavior |
|---------|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| *(no args — empty argv)* | Type 0 | `app_main` | **Type O** not-installed → install; installed+TTY → numbered list; installed+script → already-installed; see `requirement-shell-cli-zero-arguments.md` |
| `install` | Type 0 | `inst_perform_install` | Install binary for current privilege (root→global, user→local); idempotent unless force reinstall; seed local profiles |
| `version` | Type 0 | `app_version` | Print local version; JSON object when `--json` |
| `about` | Type 0 | `app_about` | Diagnostics: install presence, cache/persistence, profiles dir; JSON when `--json`; **no `CHECKSUM` field** |
| `version-check` | Type 0 | `ver_check` | Compare local vs remote `VERSION` from `SCRIPT_URL`; fail clearly if URL unset/unreachable |
| `self-update` | Type 0 | `inst_self_update` | Fetch remote version; reinstall when policy allows; reuse install primitives |
| `self-uninstall` | Type 0 | `inst_self_uninstall` | Remove managed binary; PATH cleanup only if `~/.local/bin` empty (user installs) |
| `help` | Type 0 | `app_help` | Full usage in human mode; **MUST NOT** list GitLab verbs; short JSON note in JSON mode; Environment lists channel vars only — **not** `CHECKSUM` |
| `menu` (alias `main`) | Type 0 | `app_main_menu` | Numbered list on TTY; help off-TTY. **Topic-owner:** `requirement-shell-cli-default-interaction` |
| `domains` | Invoker (read) | `app_domains` | Show saved domains. **Topic-owner:** domain REQ. Sample: `nginx-config domains` |
| `profiles` | Invoker | `app_profiles` | List expandable profiles. **Topic-owner:** domain REQ. Sample: `nginx-config profiles` |
| `nginx-conf` | Invoker | `app_nginx_conf` | Render a profile. **Topic-owner:** domain REQ. Sample: `nginx-config nginx-conf` |
| `apply` | Admin (root) | `app_apply` | Write rendered `{{domain-name}}.conf` into nginx. **Topic-owner:** domain REQ. Sample: `sudo nginx-config apply example.com` |
| `remove-lpu` | Admin (root) | `app_remove_lpu` | Remove dedicated nginx-adm. **Topic-owner:** domain REQ. Sample: `sudo nginx-config remove-lpu --force` |

#### Global flags (normative wiring for this project)

| Flag | Required wiring |
|------|-----------------|
| `--quiet`, `-q` | Set `QUIET=1` in `app_main` |
| `--json` | Set `JSON=1` and `QUIET=1` in `app_main` |
| `--debug` | Set `DEBUG=1` in `app_main` |
| `--force` | Parsed by `app_main` → `FORCE=1` and `FORCE_REINSTALL=1`; used by install reinstall, self-update (incl. deliberate downgrade), and uninstall confirm skip. **`--reset` and `--reinstall` are the same as `--force`** and **MUST** be listed in help |

#### Dispatcher acceptance criteria (this project)

1. Unknown token after flag parse → `out_die` with pointer to `nginx-config help`.  
2. Zero-arg → `requirement-shell-cli-zero-arguments` (install / numbered list / already-installed).  
3. Command routing table in `app_main` **must** include every row in the command table above.  
4. Help text **must** stay aligned with that table (no orphan commands, no listed-but-unrouted commands).  
5. User-facing strings **must not** use raw `echo`/`printf` outside the `out_*` system (protected low-level helpers excepted only if already CIAO-marked and not for general messages).

#### Explicitly out of scope until a new requirement

- Extra host-bootstrap verbs (`prerequisites`, Docker engine install as a separate command)  
- A routed Type 2 command that *is* `nginx-adm` (setup creates the account; no `nginx-config as-nginx-adm` verb)  
- Numbered main menu / `menu` command (not claimed; empty argv remains install-ensure)  

### 2.7 Why This Requirement Exists (Direct CIAO Alignment)

- **CIAO Principle 1 – Caution** (https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao): Unknown commands fail loud; force and prompts gate destructive ops; quiet/json never hide fatal errors incorrectly.  
- **CIAO Principle 2 – Intentional** (https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao): Every command has one privilege type, one handler, and documented flags.  
- **CIAO Principle 3 – Anti-fragile** (https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao): Works under TTY, `curl | sh`, quiet, and JSON; root vs user install paths.  
- **CIAO Principle 5 – Single Source of Output** and **Principle 14 – Security & Traceability** (https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao): Central `out_*`; JSON/human separation.  
- **CIAO Principle 6 – Single Point of Entry** (https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao): `app_main` is the dispatcher SSOT.  
- **CIAO Principle 10 – Least-Privilege User** (https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao): Type 0 default for CLI self-care; no invented system-user requirement for binary lifecycle.  
- **CIAO Principle 16 – Interactive vs Non-Interactive** (https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao): No hang in non-interactive; prompts only when appropriate.  
- **CIAO Principle 4 (O) / Principle 20 – Over-protect / Protect Against AI & Human Modification** (https://github.com/cloudgen/ciao): Protection Rule below blocks privilege and UX regressions.

## 3. Design Principles (CIAO / CIAO-Lite)

- **Caution:** Fail loud on bad input; never silent wrong privilege context.  
- **Intentional:** Command table + help + dispatcher stay synchronized.  
- **Anti-fragile:** Per-user and global install; network/remote optional until `SCRIPT_URL` set.  
- **Over-protect:** Do not collapse Type 0/1/2, remove JSON quiet contract, or reintroduce raw output for user messages.  
- **SSOT:** `APP_NAME` / `VERSION` / flags at config defaults; output via `out_*`; dispatch via `app_main`.  
- **Idempotency:** Already-installed install path is a no-op unless force reinstall.  
- **Respect old working logic:** Surgical changes only; preserve Protection Zones and battle-tested install/self-management helpers unless explicitly redesigning.

---

## 4. Protection Rule (Sacred)

**Future AI assistants, Grok, or maintainers MUST NOT**:

1. Remove or rename the normative Type 0 commands without updating this requirement and help together.  
2. Add Type 1 or Type 2 commands that mix host bootstrap with app toolchain in a single privileged install (three-layer privilege: Type 0 tool self-management must stay separate from Type 1 host bootstrap and Type 2 system-user app ops).  
3. Force manual `sudo` as the only UX for every elevated sub-step when internal escalation is the designed pattern (when Type 1 is introduced).  
4. Bypass `out_*` with raw user-facing `echo`/`printf` for normal messages.  
5. Break the contract that `--json` implies quiet and machine-oriented output.  
6. Drop zero-arg install-ensure for the classic `curl | sh` path (including already-installed success no-op) without an explicit requirement change (`requirement-shell-cli-zero-arguments.md`).  
7. Document flags in help that the dispatcher does not parse (or leave `--force` documented-only).  
7b. Keep a second help catalog (`show_gitlab_nginx_help` or `cat <<EOF` usage text) that lists foreign verbs (`status`, Java/Maven, timer) or omits live domain rows.  
8. Invent a dedicated system user as mandatory for Type 0 CLI self-management without a specialized architecture requirement.

**Violating this rule is a critical CLI interface regression.**

---

## 5. Definition of done (CLI interface)

This requirement is satisfied for the nginx-config shell CLI when all of the following hold:

1. Every command in §2.6 is routed and documented.  
2. Global flags in §2.6 are parsed and honored.  
3. Output modes match §2.4 (including JSON purity).  
4. Install privilege paths remain invoker-based (root/global vs user/local).  
5. Domain verbs in §2.6 are named here **and** on `requirement-domain-nginx-config` (dual mention); help lists them.  
6. Protection Rule items are not violated in code or docs.  
7. Traceability: implementation changes cite this file path / key `requirement-shell-cli-interface`.

## Under command line for normal user only

When this program runs on Termux, Git Bash, Windows Command Prompt, or the same class: **admin privilege** and **dedicated system user privilege** are unused. Do not wrap `sudo`, do not wrap Linux `apt`/`dnf`, do not create dedicated system users, and do not recommend `sudo curl | sh`. Git Bash and Windows cmd must not invoke Termux `pkg`.

**This requirement:** `apply` and `remove-lpu` are unused on that class. `domains` / `profiles` / `nginx-conf` / `menu` still work against local persistence. Self-management remains available as yourself.
